				"title": "You Really SHOULD Read This",
				"content_html": "<p>May, should, and shall. These three words can be found sprinkled across industry standards, recommended practices, and internal company procedures and guidelines. But, what do they really mean?</p>\n<p>Most of my work with industry standards happens with the American Petroleum Institute (API), so I will admittedly approach this topic mostly from that perspective. The definitions that follow come from API&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.api.org/~/media/Files/Publications/2019-API-Procedures-for-Standards-Development.pdf\">Procedures for Standards Development</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>May:</strong> Denotes a course of action permissible within the limits of a standard.</li>\n<li><strong>Should:</strong> Denotes a recommendation or that which is advised but not required in order to conform to the standard.</li>\n<li><strong>Shall:</strong> Denotes a minimum requirement in order to conform to the standard.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s work through these terms in increasing order of important. The term &ldquo;may&rdquo; describes an action that you <strong>can</strong> take, but there is no requirement that you <strong>must</strong> do this. For example, API 11B (the standard governing sucker rods) states in section 7.2.2 that calibration intervals, &ldquo;<strong>may</strong> be lengthened or shortened based on calibration history.&rdquo; So, once you establish sufficient calibration history as required by the standard, you can extend the calibration interval <strong>if you want to</strong>. If instead you prefer to always follow the specific interval written in the standard, you can do that too. <strong>May</strong> statements leave the choice entirely to the end user if they follow that course of action or not.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Should&rdquo; describes something that is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> but still not a <strong>requirement</strong> of the standard or procedure in question. The API standard for surface pumping units, API 11E, states in section 6.4.9 that, &ldquo;the tensile preload in the bolt, stud, or cap screw <strong>should</strong> be 70 % of the yield strength of the material &hellip;&rdquo;. Now, there are other ways of determining the proper preload on a connection, but the standard is recommending this one <strong>possible</strong> way to do so. If you do it this way, great! You will be in compliance with the standard. If you would like to specify the connection requirements in a different way, and can demonstrate that method performs as well or better as the <strong>should</strong> statement in the standard, great! You have the flexibility to apply whichever you believe works best for your product and manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p>Now we come to the heavy lifter, the &ldquo;shall&rdquo; statement. <strong>Shall</strong> statements say you absolutely, positively, <strong>must</strong> follow this statement to comply with the standard or procedure in question. The twenty-seventh edition of API 11B has 544 instances of the word shall spread throughout it! Section 6.3.2.2 covers material test reports, and has some requirements for how long these records must be kept. &ldquo;These documents <strong>shall</strong> be maintained by the manufacturer for a period of at least five years.&rdquo; If someone trashes a pile of MTRs after four years and 364 days, they are not in compliance with the standard.</p>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s relate this back to something more applicable to everyday life. You want your kids to brush their teeth every night before bed, right? Which of the above terms best describe your desire for them to follow this routine? Would you prefer that they <em>may</em> brush their teeth, they <em>should</em> brush their teeth, or they <strong>shall</strong> brush their teeth?</p>\n",

If instead you prefer to always follow the specific interval written in the standard, you can do that too. **May** statements leave the choice entirely to the end user if they follow that course of action or not.\n\n \"Should\" describes something that is **strongly recommended** but still not a **requirement** of the standard or procedure in question. The API standard for surface pumping units, API 11E, states in section 6.4.9 that, \"the tensile preload in the bolt, stud, or cap screw **should** be 70 % of the yield strength of the material ...\". Now, there are other ways of determining the proper preload on a connection, but the standard is recommending this one **possible** way to do so. If you do it this way, great! You will be in compliance with the standard. If you would like to specify the connection requirements in a different way, and can demonstrate that method performs as well or better as the **should** statement in the standard, great! You have the flexibility to apply whichever you believe works best for your product and manufacturing processes. \n \n Now we come to the heavy lifter, the \"shall\" statement. **Shall** statements say you absolutely, positively, **must** follow this statement to comply with the standard or procedure in question. The twenty-seventh edition of API 11B has 544 instances of the word shall spread throughout it! Section 6.3.2.2 covers material test reports, and has some requirements for how long these records must be kept. \"These documents **shall** be maintained by the manufacturer for a period of at least five years.\" If someone trashes a pile of MTRs after four years and 364 days, they are not in compliance with the standard. \n \n Let's relate this back to something more applicable to everyday life. You want your kids to brush their teeth every night before bed, right? Which of the above terms best describe your desire for them to follow this routine? Would you prefer that they _may_ brush their teeth, they _should_ brush their teeth, or they **shall** brush their teeth?\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The American Petroleum Institute holds two main meetings each year, where its members gather to work on standards development. The winter meeting was held from 20-24 January in Fort Worth, TX, and brought together representatives from manufacturers, distributors, and end-users of products that are affected by API standards. I have the honor of chairing Subcommittee 11, which oversees standards that cover rod pumps, sucker rods, pumping units, plungers, and reciprocating compressors. Several of the task groups that fall under SC11 met that week and are actively working on updating many of our standards. A summary of each group&rsquo;s activities follows below.</p>\n<p>If you are a user of the products covered by these standards or are involved in the manufacturing and distribution of those products, I would encourage you to get involved in SC11 and the development of these standards. The work of these task groups materially impacts your business, and your voice should be part of guiding their work. For some, I&rsquo;ve heard it is an issue of cost to travel and take part in these meetings. For some perspective, my expenses for a week in Fort Worth were less than what my company spends on one downhole rod pump. I think that&rsquo;s a small price to pay to be able to impact how that pump is designed and built before it makes it to my location.
